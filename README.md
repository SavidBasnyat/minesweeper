# minesweeper

**I contributed in this project as part of a Lab I did for one of my Computer Science courses. It is the minesweeper game built using Java. There are 3 different levels for this game and the player has the option to restart or reveal the board at anytime. The player wins when they successfully uncover all the boxes. I coded the MineSweeperBoard.java file.**
